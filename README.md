### ðŸ“š Case Study Series: Database Systems

I built a two-part case study around an airline reservation system to explore both relational and non-relational database design.

- **[Airline Reservation â€” SQL](https://github.com/hibahmasoom36/airline-reservation-sql-project):** Normalized schema, queries, and performance analysis in PostgreSQL.  
- **[Airline Reservation â€” NoSQL](https://github.com/hibahmasoom36/airline-reservation-nosql-project):** JSON-based model in MongoDB with hybrid architecture analysis.  

ðŸ‘‰ Together, these projects highlight my ability to compare, optimize, and design systems across SQL and NoSQL paradigms.
